Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University. I study US public opinion, with interests in political psychology, mass polarization, and racial/ethnic attitudes (especially among white Democrats). 

**I will be on the 2023-2024 job market seeking academic employment.** 

## Research Areas
My dissertation research examines public opinion formation and intergroup behavior among white Americans, especially those who express progressive racial attitudes. A short article motivating this research, which traces the unprecedented liberalization in white Democrats' racial attitudes since the 2010s, was recently published (open-access) in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/86/S1/576/6617224). See my [working papers](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers) for other ongoing research regarding racial/ethnic politics. 

Additionally, I have a number of political psychology projects that explore how citizens' weigh between instrumental and symbolic political motivations, and the implications of these trade-offs for (in)consistencies in mass opinion formation and political behavior. Some of my work on this topic is published in [*Political Behavior*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09828-9). I also have a [working paper](https://trentoll.github.io/files/ruralconsc_05.24.2023.pdf) on the contingent relationship between rural consciousness and political identification and preferences for instrumentally- vs. symbolically-minded rural Americans. 

Finally, I enjoy replication-style studies. In 2022, I published a large-N replication study in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/86/2/369/6575714) on the contingent relationships between personality traits and ideology. I have two other replication-style studies, respectively R&Red in [*Political Science Research and Methods*](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers/psrm_values_05.24.23.pdf) and [*Research & Politics*](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers/auth_2016primaries_05.24.23.pdf). Independent replication attempts of my research **strongly encouraged!**

## Duke RA Hiring
I am currently project manager for the *Politics and Polarization in Mainline Protestant Congregations* research team. Our team is conducting a large-N data collection effort for United Methodist pastors' sermons (2020-2021) for text-as-data analyses related to politics, social issues, and polarization. 

**Duke students with interests in religion, American politics, or text analysis seeking paid RA positions, please contact me about openings.**
