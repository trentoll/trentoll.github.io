Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University. I study US public opinion, with interests in political psychology, mass polarization, and racial/ethnic attitudes (especially among white Democrats). 

**I will be seeking academic employment on the 2023-2024 job market.** [Job Market Paper](https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/article-details/6488b1c9be16ad5c57e1ae90)

## Research Areas
**Race/Ethnicity:** My dissertation research examines public opinion formation and intergroup behavior among white Americans, especially those who express progressive racial attitudes. A short article motivating this research, which traces the unprecedented liberalization in white Democrats' racial attitudes since the 2010s, was recently published (open-access) in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/86/S1/576/6617224). See my [working papers](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers) for other ongoing research on racial/ethnic politics. 

**Political Psychology:** I have a number of political psychology projects that explore how citizens' weigh between instrumental and symbolic political motivations, and the implications of these trade-offs for (in)consistencies in mass opinion formation. Some of my work on this topic is published in [*Political Behavior*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09828-9). I also have a [working paper](https://doi.org/10.33774/apsa-2023-h0x53) on the contingent relationship between rural consciousness and political preferences for instrumentally- vs. symbolically-minded rural Americans. 

**Replications:** I see immense value in replication studies. In 2022, I published a large-N replication study on the contingent relationships between personality traits and ideology in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/86/2/369/6575714). Two other replication-style studies have been invited to R&R in [*Political Science Research and Methods*](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers/psrm_values_05.24.23.pdf) and [*Research & Politics*](https://trentoll.github.io/workingpapers/auth_2016primaries_05.24.23.pdf).
