Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University.

**I will be seeking academic employment on the 2023-2024 job market.** [CV](https://trentoll.github.io/files/cv_07.04.23.pdf)

## Research Areas
**Race/Ethnicity:** My dissertation examines public opinion formation and intergroup behavior among white Americans, especially those who express ostensibly progressive racial attitudes. A short article that motivates this research agenda by tracing an unprecedented liberalization in white Democrats' racial attitudes has been published open-access in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/86/S1/576/6617224). 

**Political Psychology:** I have a number of political psychology projects exploring how personality, identity, and political engagement/sophistication influence public opinion formation. Some of my work on this topic has been published in [*Political Behavior*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09828-9). 

**Replications:** I see immense value in replication studies. So far, I've published three: (1) a study on the contingent relationships between personality and ideology in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/86/2/369/6575714); (2) a study reevaluating the relationships between affective polarization and political values forthcoming in [*Political Science Research and Methods*](https://trentoll.github.io/files/psrm_values_05.24.23.pdf); and (3) a study on the association between psychological authoritarianism and 2016 primary voters' candidate preferences in [*Research & Politics*](https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680231188258). 

## Duke RA Hiring
