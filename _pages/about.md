Hello! I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at Duke University. I study public opinion formation, with interests in political psychology, mass polarization, and racial/ethnic attitudes (especially among white Democrats). **I will be on the academic market 2023-2024.** 

My dissertation research examine public opinion formation and intergroup behavior among white Americans who express racially-progressive attitudes. A research note motivating this research, which traces the unprecedented liberalization in white Democrats' racial attitudes since the 2010s, was recently published (open-access) in [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/86/S1/576/6617224). 

Additionally, I have a number of projects that explore how citizens' trade-off between instrumental and symbolic political motivations, and the implications of these trade-offs for (in)consistencies in mass opinion formation and political behavior. Some of my published work on this topic can be found in [*Political Behavior*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-022-09828-9) and [*Public Opinion Quarterly*](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/86/2/369/6575714). 

I am also currently a project manager on the *Politics and Polarization in Mainline Protestant Congregations* research team. **Duke students with interests in religion, politics, race, and/or text analysis seeking (paid!) RA work during the 2023-2024 academic year, please contact me about openings.**
