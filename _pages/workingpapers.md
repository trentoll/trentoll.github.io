## Affective Polarization and the Destabilization of Core Political Values

*Status: R&R at Political Science Research and Methods*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Longitudinal analyses of survey data from 1992-1996 show that extremity in political values was associated with increased affective polarization among Americans during this period, whereas affective polarization was unrelated to increased value extremity (Enders and Lupton 2021). In this paper, I reevaluate the relationships between value extremity and affective polarization using the recent 2016-2020 ANES panel. Replicating Enders and Lupton’s analytical procedures as closely as possible with this new sample, I find that political value extremity is sometimes associated with increased affective polarization during this period, but that affective polarization is consistently and more strongly associated with increased value extremity. These updated findings suggest that values may have become endogenous to Americans’ evaluations of salient political objects, such as parties, presidential candidates, and ideological groups.

## Authoritarianism and Support for Trump and Clinton in the 2016 Primaries

*Status: R&R at Research & Politics*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Research in the wake of the contentious 2016 presidential primaries contends both Democrats and Republicans were internally divided along psychological lines. Specifically, MacWilliams (2016) finds authoritarian personality was strongly related to Trump support among Republican primary voters, and Wronski et al. (2018) finds authoritarianism was strongly related to support for Clinton among Democratic primary voters. In this paper, I reassess the relationships between authoritarianism and 2016 primary candidate preferences for both Republicans and Democrats. I analyze two new large, probability-based surveys and generate random effects estimates using these surveys and the two national surveys made available by Wronski et al. (2018). Overall, I find authoritarianism was moderately associated with support for Clinton over Sanders among Democrats, but weakly associated with support for Trump among Republicans. My findings indicate authoritarianism may have played a more limited role in shaping Americans’ candidate preferences in the 2016 presidential primary elections than past studies have suggested.

## White Racial Polarization Before and After the Election of Donald Trump (Chapter for *Changing American Right* Edited Volume)
**With Ashley E. Jardina**

*Status: Complete, Pre-Publication*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: This chapter traces white polarization on issues of race and ethnicity before and after the 2016 election of Donald Trump. We find that white Americans were already somewhat polarized in racial attitudes, immigration opinion, and views of Muslim Americans prior to Trump's election; however, in 2016 and beyond, polarization along these dimensions increased. White Democrats, in particular, have moved in a liberal dimension along these dimensions. Furthermore, the associations between racial, immigration, and religious attitudes and voting behavior have strengthened over time, and these associations are particularly strong in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

## Rural Consciousness and its Heterogeneous Associations with Political Identities and Economic Preferences

*Status: Under Review*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Although rural Americans’ sense of place-based consciousness has been an influential explanation for their right-wing politics, recent studies show rural consciousness is only weakly associated with Republican partisanship and conservatism. I show this incongruity is explained by the heterogeneous associations of rural consciousness to political behavior. Among politically engaged Americans, rural consciousness is associated with right-wing political identification and economic conservatism. Among politically disengaged Americans, however, rural consciousness is associated with left-wing identification and economic liberalism. This heterogeneity emerges due to the downweighing of instrumental, material concerns among politically engaged citizens relative to symbolic, identity-based considerations. Thus, how rural consciousness translates into political behavior is contingent on the motivations citizens bring to bear in political decision-making. In this way, past studies have overlooked how strong rural consciousness’s associations with right-wing political behavior are for politically engaged Americans, as well as its moderate associations with left-wing politics among politically disengaged Americans.

## Observable Bounds of Rationality and Credibility in International Relations (*REGISTERED REPORT*)
**With Andrew Kenealy and So Jin Lee**

*Status: Under Review*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: In crisis bargaining scenarios, resolved states send costly signals to demonstrate a willingness to fight. Yet public signals of resolve are issued by specific leaders, who operate with cognitive limitations in challenging decision environments. Drawing upon theories of behavioral economics, we develop a series of observable indicators plausibly connected to leader ability and difficulty of decision environment that we expect interactively shape perceived signaler
credibility: capable leaders should be better able to overcome difficult decision environments. Effects, we argue, are due to perceived variation in the signaler’s uncertainty over the future costs at stake. Preliminary analysis of a pilot conjoint experiment provides suggestive support for expectations. Existing scholarship on credibility in IR emphasizes the value of power and of appearing tough; if confirmed, our results demonstrate the importance of appearing reasoned and methodical—qualities that most policymakers already strive to publicly convey.
