## Affective Polarization and the Destabilization of Core Political Values

*Status: Accepted at Political Science Research and Methods*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Longitudinal analyses of survey data from 1992-1996 show that extremity in political values was associated with increased affective polarization among Americans during this period, whereas affective polarization was unrelated to increased value extremity (Enders and Lupton 2021). In this paper, I reevaluate the relationships between value extremity and affective polarization using the recent 2016-2020 ANES panel. Replicating Enders and Lupton’s analytical procedures as closely as possible with this new sample, I find that political value extremity is sometimes associated with increased affective polarization during this period, but that affective polarization is consistently and more strongly associated with increased value extremity. These updated findings suggest that values may have become endogenous to Americans’ evaluations of salient political objects, such as parties, presidential candidates, and ideological groups.

## Observable Bounds of Rationality and Credibility in International Relations (*REGISTERED REPORT*)
**With Andrew Kenealy and So Jin Lee**

*Status: R&R at Journal of Politics*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: In crisis bargaining scenarios, resolved states send costly signals to demonstrate a willingness to fight. Yet public signals of resolve are issued by specific leaders, who operate with cognitive limitations in challenging decision environments. Drawing upon theories of behavioral economics, we develop a series of observable indicators plausibly connected to leader ability and difficulty of decision environment that we expect interactively shape perceived signaler
credibility: capable leaders should be better able to overcome difficult decision environments. Effects, we argue, are due to perceived variation in the signaler’s uncertainty over the future costs at stake. Preliminary analysis of a pilot conjoint experiment provides suggestive support for expectations. Existing scholarship on credibility in IR emphasizes the value of power and of appearing tough; if confirmed, our results demonstrate the importance of appearing reasoned and methodical—qualities that most policymakers already strive to publicly convey.

## White Racial Polarization Before and After the Election of Donald Trump (Chapter for *Changing American Right* Edited Volume)
**With Ashley E. Jardina**

*Status: Forthcoming in Edited Volume*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: This chapter traces white polarization on issues of race and ethnicity before and after the 2016 election of Donald Trump. We find white Americans were already somewhat polarized in racial attitudes, immigration opinion, and views of Muslims prior to Trump's election; however, in 2016 and beyond, polarization along these dimensions increased. White Democrats, in particular, have moved in a liberal direction along these dimensions. Furthermore, the associations between racial, immigration, and religious attitudes and voting behavior have strengthened over time, and these associations are particularly strong in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

## The Heterogeneous Associations of Rural Consciousness and Political Preferences

*Status: Under Review*  |  *First Posted: May 24th, 2023*  |  *Current Version: June 13th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Although rural Americans’ sense of place-based consciousness has been an influential explanation for their right-wing politics, recent studies have often found rural consciousness is weakly associated with Republican partisanship and conservatism. Analyzing the 2020 American National Election Study and reanalyzing three recent studies of rural consciousness, I show this incongruity is explained by heterogeneity in how rural consciousness is associated with political preferences. For politically engaged Americans, rural consciousness is associated with right-wing partisan-ideological identification and economic conservatism. For disengaged Americans, however, rural consciousness is associated with left-wing identification and economic liberalism. This heterogeneity emerges due to the downweighting of instrumental concerns among politically engaged citizens relative to symbolic, identity-based concerns. Thus, how rural consciousness is translated into political preferences is contingent on citizens’ relative weighting of competing instrumental and symbolic motivations, which push the rurally-conscious in opposite directions in terms of partisanship, ideological identification, and economic policy preferences.

## A Difference-in-Differences Approach for Estimating Survey Mode Effects

*Status: Under Review*  |  *First Posted: June 23rd, 2023*  |  *Current Version: July 22nd, 2023*

**Abstract**: A survey’s mode can influence both who takes the survey (selection) and how they respond to its questionnaire (measurement). To distinguish selection and measurement effects, most studies of mode effects use cross-sectional designs. However, cross-sectional designs risk omitted variable bias when the selection process is not fully modeled, but post-treatment bias if the selection process is modeled with variables measured in different survey modes. To address these shortcomings, I propose using difference-in-differences with mixed-mode panel surveys to identify measurement effects. Difference-in-differences compares changes in survey responses over time among panelists who switch modes to panelists who do not switch modes. Difference-in-differences can help reduce omitted variable bias without introducing post-treatment bias. I demonstrate the difference-in-differences approach by estimating the effects of completing live interviews vs. online surveys on the measurement of racial attitudes and political knowledge in the 2016-2020 ANES and cognitive functioning in the 1992-2020 Health and Retirement Study.
