## Rural Consciousness and its Heterogeneous Associations with Political Identities and Economic Preferences

*First Posted: May 24th, 2023*

*Current Version: May 24th, 2023*

**Abstract**: Although rural Americans’ sense of place-based consciousness has been an influential explanation for their right-wing politics, recent studies show rural consciousness is only weakly associated with Republican partisanship and conservatism. I show this incongruity is explained by the heterogeneous associations of rural consciousness to political behavior. Among politically engaged Americans, rural consciousness is associated with right-wing political identification and economic conservatism. Among politically disengaged Americans, however, rural consciousness is associated with left-wing identification and economic liberalism. This heterogeneity emerges due to the downweighing of instrumental, material concerns among politically engaged citizens relative to symbolic, identity-based considerations. Thus, how rural consciousness translates into political behavior is contingent on the motivations citizens bring to bear in political decision-making. In this way, past studies have overlooked how strong rural consciousness’s associations with right-wing political behavior are for politically engaged Americans, as well as its moderate associations with left-wing politics among politically disengaged Americans.
